    "|Dương Nhật Huy|- Various techniques must be employed to effectively crawl data from sources, overcoming the inherent limitations.<br>- Columns like Cast, Director, and Genre often contain a multitude of values, making it challenging to analyze and preprocess effectively.|- Demonstrates proficiency in utilizing a variety of techniques for efficient data crawling.<br>- Skilled in leveraging feature relationships to effectively handle and fill missing values.<br>- Proficient in creating interactive form interfaces within Jupyter Notebook for seamless model input.|\n",
    "|Trương Thuận Kiệt|- Had difficulty in distributing tasks for each members. <br>- Resolving conflicts of notebook on GitHub. <br>- Decision to choose which approach to handle missing data of numerical columns.|- Got to know the process of data science. <br> - Know how to model data and how to hyper-tune models|\n",
    "|Phạm Minh Mẫn|- Dataset is heavily missing, require complicating imputation technique. <br>- Model involves heavy one-hot encoding because there are many categorical variables.|- How to deal with real world data<br>- Different imputation technique : KNN, Decision Tree. <br>- How to one-hot encoding complicated datasets.<br>- How attributes like genres, ratings, release date, studio,... affect a movie|\n",
    "|Hồ Đăng Phúc|- Crawling data wasn’t as straightforward as expected. The website had anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHA and dynamic content loading, which made things more complicated.<br>- Dealt with inconsistencies and irrelevant categories.<br>- Categorical data came with inconsistencies, like different spellings, capitalization issues, and irrelevant categories, which could negatively impact the model’s performance.|- Using the right tools, like Selenium for dynamic content or Scrapy for large-scale scraping.<br>- Important to handle missing values and outliers carefully to ensure the data was clean and reliable."
